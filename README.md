# GICF
Code for optimizing a Group Instance Cost Function in MIL.

This repository is where the code that implements the paper From Group to Individual Labels using Deep Features lives.
The original paper can be found [here](http://dkotzias.com/papers/GICF.pdf)

The data for the labelled sentences for sentiment can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Sentiment+Labelled+Sentences)

Unfortunatelly I cannot provide the group level data as the original datasets do not belong to me. You can find links for them in the paper. 

In order to create the embeddings the code for the convnet is available [here](https://github.com/mdenil/txtnets).
